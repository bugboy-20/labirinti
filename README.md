# labirinti
Calculate all possible labyrinths in a rectangle given size, and in and out coordinates

![Sample labyrinth](/old/sample.png)

Written in early '90s in basic, then edited in qbasic in '95, ported to vbscript in 2013.
Now available in python!

It has been ported directly from vbscript, code could be better and faster.

Please help me to improve it.

# Usage
Call labirinti adding dimensions, starting point and ending point (x and y)

The file generated contains one labyrinth per row, 1 = right, 2 = bottom, 3 = left, 4 = top
